Final ML project for the Machine Learning course of Ecole des Mines de Nancy

Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/vinayshanbhag/radar-traffic-data

## Prepare the environment
Install Anaconda 
 `conda env create -f environment.yaml` to create the env
 `conda activate dl_env` to activate the env 
 
 `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dl_env` to add the configurated env as a jupyter kernel
 
 
##TODO : 

- We need to have a bit more data, check the open_data file . And set to 0 when only a few data are missing.
But if the whole day is missing : do something else
- Check with a more complex task if the training still works
